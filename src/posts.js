    postContent: "Asta and Yuno were abandoned together at the same church and have been inseparable since. As children, they promised that they would compete against each other to see who would become the next Wizard King. However, as they grew up the differences in their abilities became considerably noticeable. Yuno was a genius in his magic control and power, whilst Asta possessed no magic at all so he trained his physical body as much as possible in an attempt to make up for his lack of magic. Having received their Grimoires at age 15, Yuno unexpectedly got one with a four leaf clover symbol on his whilst Asta unfortunately did not even get a Grimoire at all. However, when Yuno was threatened, the truth about Asta's power was revealed, he received a five leaf clover Grimoire, a \"black clover\". Now the two friends are heading out in the world, both seeking the same goal.",

    postTitle: "Attack on Titan: Inconsistent But Epic",
    postContent: "Humans are nearly exterminated by giant creatures called Titans. Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a land protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans. Flash forward to the present, and mankind has not seen a titan in over 100 years. One day, 10 year old Eren and his childhood friend Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as Eren's mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.",
